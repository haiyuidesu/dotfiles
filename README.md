## Notes
- This repo is basically a very low-efforts dotfiles repo that is enough for me to use when I setup a new macOS machine.

- I may add enough content in order to setup freshly installed Linux distributions in the future.

- You can place your dot files (such as .zshrc or .gitconfig) file in the folder `config`, they will be copied to your home directory.
